                                            - Funds not tied-up. Leasing diversifies funding sources and does not tie-up existing working capital or credit lines.
                                            <br/>
                                            - Cash flow benefits. Instalment payments are determined at the inception of a lease and therefore assist with expense budgeting and cash flow forecasting.

                                            <br/>
                                            - Certainty. A lease is a fixed-term contract during which the instalment amount cannot be modified, nor is it cancellable by the lessor (unless breach of contract occurs), while an overdraft or a bank loan may be payable on demand and may be reduced at the discretion of the lender.

                                            <br/>
                                            - Flexible. Leasing arrangements are very flexible and can be designed for up to a seven-year period to suit the cash flow requirements of the lessee.
